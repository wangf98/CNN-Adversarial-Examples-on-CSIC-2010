# CNN-Adversarial-Exemples-on-CSIC-2010
Two parts are included:
---
* An implement of CNN on CSIC 2010 database
* Get some adversarial exmemples using gradiat descending method based on the existing CNN 

All data files are in the data folder.
All source codes are in the code folder.

Run train_attack_detect.py to train the CNN.
Run train_attack__detect_linear to train a linear network on CSIC dataset.
attack_fast_gradient.py and test_adversarial.py provide 2 different ways to change the rural sample into an adversarial sample.
